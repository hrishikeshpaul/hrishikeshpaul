Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Paul, a Software Engineer (Frontend) at [Reputation](https://reputation.com/). I'm a Computer Science graduate student from Indiana University Bloomington with an interest in Software Development, UX Design and Artificial Intelligence!

As an international student, I have repeatedly been exposed to new cultures and diverse groups of people. This has made me able to quickly adapt to changes, and gain a broader perspective. Iâ€™m always curious about technology and enjoy learning. I am a detail oriented person and I keep my goals and tasks organized to maintain productivity.
