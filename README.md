Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Paul, a Computer Science graduate from Indiana University Bloomington with an interest in Software Development, UX Design and Artificial Intelligence - and seeking exciting opportunities related to the same.

As an international student, I have repeatedly been exposed to new cultures and diverse groups of people. This has made me able to quickly adapt to changes, and gain a broader perspective. Iâ€™m always curious about technology and enjoy learning. I am a detail oriented person and I keep my goals and tasks organized to maintain productivity.
